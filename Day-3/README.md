<img src="task1of3.png"
     alt="Ouput" />
 * Used Conditional statements syntax: if/else (either a or b)
  * if whatever:
  	do this
    else:
    	do this
 * more arithmetric operators:
  * `<` is less than
  * `>` is greater than
  * `<=` is less or equal to
  * `>=` is greater or equal to
  * `==` is eqal to
  * `!=` is not equal to
  * `=` is an assignment i.e when assigning variables

## Task 2
<img src="task2of3.png"
     alt="Ouput" />
* used modulo `(%)`. It divides though 2 given intergers and outputs the remainder

## Task 3
<img src="task3of3.png"
     alt="Ouput" />
* learnt `nested if/else statements` statements
* used `elif` (more like a 2nd condition, not true (if) and not false (else))
 * elif can  be one or more between if and else
* used fstring and arithmetric operators from previous lessons also
